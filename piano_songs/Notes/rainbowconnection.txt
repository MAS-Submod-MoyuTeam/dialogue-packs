RAINBOW CONNECTION

Verse:

Why are there so many songs about rainbows

And what's on the other side?

And rainbows have nothing to hide

Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection

The lovers, the dreamers, and me

Who said that every wish would be heard and answered 8
4 T 7 O 0* 7 I
When wished on the morning star?

Somebody thought of that, and someone believed it

Look what it's done so far

What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing
