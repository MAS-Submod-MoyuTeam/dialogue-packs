Come along with me
2 W E Y R

And the butterflies and bees
Y U 9 U Y U U Y

We can wander through the forest
Y U 9 U Y U R Y

And do so as we please
W E Y Y 2 Q

Come along with me
2 W E Y R

To a cliff under a tree
Y U 9 U Y U U Y

Where we can gaze upon the water
Y U 9 U Y U R Y

As an everlasting dream
E R Y 6 U Y

All of my collections
9 9 9 U U Y

I'll share them all with you
E R Y Y 2 2

Maybe by next summer
9 O 9 U U Y

We won't have changed our tunes
W E Y Y 9 9 U

We'll still want to be
2 W E Y R

With the butterflies and bees
Y U 9 U Y U U Y

Making up new numbers
9 U Y U R Y

And living so merrily
E R Y Y U U Y

All of my collections
9 9 9 U U Y

I'll share them all with you
E R Y Y 2 2

I'll be here for you always
W 9 O 9 U U Y

And always be with you
W E Y Y 9 9 U

Come along with me
2 W E Y R

And the butterflies and bees
Y U 9 U Y U U Y

We can wander through the forest
Y U 9 U Y U R Y

And do so as we please
U 9 U Y U Y

Living so merrily
R Y Y 6 U Y
